This workshop report describes a theft detection method for the Vehicle Connectivity Gateway (VCG), a telematics and diagnostics device developed at DSA \cite{VCG}. After a short introduction, this report introduces the technologies used for this approach. Then a theft detection algorithm will be presented and evaluated. The algorithm uses a decision tree to detect whether a car or trailer is stolen or not.
