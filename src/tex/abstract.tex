This written workshop report describes a theft detection method for Vehicle Connectivity Gateway (VCG). After a short introduction this report describes the used technologies for this approach. Then a theft detection algorithm will be presented and evaluated. The algorithm uses a decision tree to detect wether a car or trailer is stolen or not.
