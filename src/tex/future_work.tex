\chapter{Future Work}
In our program, basic functions for theft detection are implemented, which are necessary for the correct operation of the program. Still, some weak points remain which can be improved in the future:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use binary mode to read from acceleration sensor to avoid parsing the data manually as a string
	\item Calibrate acceleration sensor threshold based on in-the-field testing (e.g. beside a highway)
	\item Test all branches of the algorithm, ideally with real vehicle data
\end{itemize}
