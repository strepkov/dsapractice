\chapter{Future Work}
In our program was implemented the basic functions for chief detection algorithm, which are necessary for correct operation of the program. But still there are some weak points which can be improved in the future: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use binary mode to read from acceleration sensor
	\item Calibrate acceleration sensor threshold based on in-the-field testing (e.g. beside a highway)
\end{itemize}
